Minor modifications for standalone uk/en version by
[Santiago Chávez Novaro](mailto:sanxofon@gmail.com)

### Changes made

- Language switch hack to allow fast switching from *English* to *Ukrainian*.
- CSS, HTML and JS are hardcoded on `index.html` without no changes to app itself (all can be moved to `app.html` if needed)
- All dependencies, including `cindy-viwewer-js` were moved inside app folder (some unused items were omitted).
- Simple translations were added on `app.json`
- Ukrainian translation added to `tr/uk.json`
- Default language is now `uk`.

### ToDo

- Replace *English/Українська* words with language switch icon.
