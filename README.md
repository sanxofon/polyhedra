Reduce, repack and minor modifications for standalone uk/en version

### Changes made

- CSS, HTML and JS are hardcoded on `index.html` without no changes to app itself (all can be moved to `app.html` if needed)
- All dependencies, including `cindy-viwewer-js` were moved inside app folder (some unused items were omitted).
- Simple translations were added on `app.json`
- Ukrainian translation added to `tr/uk.json`
- Default language is now `uk`.
